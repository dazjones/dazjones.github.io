Hey there, I'm Darren.

By day, I'm a seasoned Senior Engineering Manager, navigating the ever-evolving landscape of tech and all things digital. But when the sun sets and the work laptop gets tucked away, you'll often find me strumming a guitar, chasing melodies, and escaping to the breathtaking Scottish Highlands whenever I can.

## Work Life

With a passion for all things code and tech, I've spent years honing my skills and diving headfirst into the world of platform engineering. I thrive on the challenges it throws my way, the constant innovation, and the opportunity to lead talented teams toward success. My journey in the tech realm has been nothing short of thrilling, and I'm always up for a good tech talk or a deep dive into the latest industry trends.

## Play Time

But life isn't all about work, right? When I'm not in "manager mode," I'm all about letting my creative side run wild. Music has been a lifelong companion for me. Whether I'm strumming the strings of my guitar, composing tunes, or just jamming with friends, music fuels my soul and adds a rich melody to my life.

And then there are those weekends away in the Scottish Highlands. Ah, the rugged beauty, the misty lochs, and the craggy peaks! It's my go-to escape from the daily grind. Soaking up the tranquil vistas (or the single malts), while immersing myself in the wild beauty of Scotland is my idea of a perfect getaway.

## Why This Website?

This website is my way of sharing the different facets of my life with you. From tech insights and musings on leadership to music adventures, I hope you find something here that resonates with you. It's a place where my professional side meets my personal passions, and I'm excited to have you along for the ride.
