# djns.io - Personal Blog

Welcome to the repository for [djns.io](https://djns.io), my personal blog hosted on GitHub Pages and built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## About

djns.io is a place where I share my thoughts, projects, and experiences. The blog is powered by Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator.

## Getting Started

To set up a local version of the blog for development or contributions, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) (extended version recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/djns.io.git
   cd djns.io
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**

    Ensure you have the Hugo extended version installed. For more details, visit Hugo's installation guide.

3. **Run the development server:**
```sh
hugo server --config config/_default/config.toml -D
```
The site will be available at http://localhost:1313/.

## Deployment
The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on the main branch. Simply push changes to this branch, and GitHub Actions will handle the deployment.

## Contributing

I welcome sensible contributions, but given that it is a personal blog I wouldn't expect any! If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch.
