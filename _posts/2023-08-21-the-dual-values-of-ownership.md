We often find ourselves caught up in the allure of instant gratification. The desire for immediate rewards has gradually shifted our focus away from the deeper significance of ownership. It is important to recognise that everything we possess carries both a cost of ownership, and a cost of mastery.

## The Cost of Ownership

The cost of ownership refers to the financial investment required to acquire an item. Whether it's a car, a piece of furniture, or a home, the price we pay is the initial entry into ownership. However, we should also consider the ongoing expenses that come with maintaining and sustaining the item. From repairs and upkeep to insurance and utilities, ownership entails a continuous financial commitment.

## The Value of Mastery

On the other hand, the cost of mastery is the investment of time, effort, and dedication needed to truly understand and excel in using or appreciating what we own. Mastery goes beyond mere possession; it involves developing the skills, knowledge, and expertise to maximise the value and potential of an item. Whether it's honing a craft, deepening our understanding of a subject, or mastering a skill, the pursuit of mastery enriches our experience and deepens our connection with what we own.

However, the current societal trend towards instant gratification has led us to prioritise the cost of ownership over the cost of mastery. With the rise of on-demand services, disposable goods, and a culture of quick fixes, the focus has shifted towards the convenience of acquiring and discarding possessions rather than investing the time and effort to truly master them. This shift has inadvertently diminished our appreciation for the long-lasting benefits that come with genuine mastery.

## Finding Balance

With the unconcious need for instant gratification, we risk missing out on the profound sense of fulfilment that comes from investing ourselves in the process of learning and growing. True mastery brings a level of satisfaction that transcends the initial excitement of ownership. It enables us to fully explore the potential of what we own, fostering a deeper connection and a greater sense of accomplishment.

So, in a society that constantly tempts us with quick fixes and immediate satisfaction, let us not forget the dual values of ownership: the cost of ownership and the cost of mastery. Let us strive to strike a balance, appreciating the importance of both aspects. By investing in our own growth and development, we can reclaim forgotten joy and rekindle our connection with the things we own.
